9. Listen to server staff
  9.1. If a moderator tells you to stop doing something, stop it
  9.2. Don't argue about mod decisions in chat. If you'd like to discuss or dispute a decision, please message @Ninjoy.

In addition to these rules, the moderation team reserves the right to remove messages and users from the server that are detrimental to the discussion and community. Since this is the first page you are seeing, ignorance of the rules does not excuse breaking them.
